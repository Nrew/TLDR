## Overview
A text summarization project that leverages transformer-based models to generate summaries of long documents or articles. This tool automates the summarization process, extracting essential information and providing concise summaries.

## Project Scope
- Type of Summarization: [Abstractive/Extractive]
- Target Content: [Specify the domain or type of content you're summarizing, e.g., news articles, legal documents]

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Hugging Face's Transformers
- [Other libraries and tools you used]

## Getting Started
[Provide instructions on how to set up the development environment and get the project running. Include any installation steps or prerequisites.]

## Data Collection
- [Describe how you gathered the dataset of long documents or articles. Mention the sources or methods used.]

## Data Preprocessing
- [Explain the data preprocessing steps, such as cleaning, tokenization, and handling special characters.]

## Pretrained Transformer Model
- [Specify the pretrained transformer model you used (e.g., BERT, GPT-2) and how you loaded it using Hugging Face's Transformers library.]

## Fine-Tuning
- [Detail how you created a custom dataset for fine-tuning the model, and how the fine-tuning process was carried out.]

## Model Evaluation
- [Discuss how you evaluated the model's performance using NLP evaluation metrics like ROUGE.]

## User Interface and Deployment
- [Explain how users can interact with the summarization tool through a web interface or other means. Describe how you deployed the application using a cloud platform.]

## Documentation and Version Control
- [Discuss the project's documentation, code comments, and the use of version control (e.g., Git).]

## Scalability
- [Explain how the project is optimized for scalability, especially when handling large volumes of text.]

## Continuous Learning
- [Mention how you plan to keep the project up to date with the latest developments in NLP and transformer models.]
